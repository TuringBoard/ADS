Each electrical component has a specific power requirement and this layer is responsible for providing that power.

\subsection{Subsystem 1}
The entire module consists of a Li-Po battery which provides power to a Buck Converter which then powers the rest of the system.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Assumptions}
The batteries are expected to allow the user to ride the long board for at least 30 minutes without requiring recharging.

\subsubsection{Responsibilities}
The Batteries would ideally provide around 24V which would then be stepped down to 19V for the Jetson TX-2 and 5V if an auxiliary microcontroller is connected.

\subsubsection{Subsystem Interfaces}
Each of the inputs and outputs for the subsystem are defined here.
